**CONNECTIVE SDH** allows you to create webapps with server-side (static) and client-side (dynamic) rendering using JSX and [**CONNECTIVE HTML**](https://github.com/CONNECT-platform/connective-html).

Features:
- Fast SSR: pre-render or directly respond to requests
- JSX-based simple component syntax for reusability
- Transport components: mark components that are to be rendered on client-side for interactivity and they will be rendered on client side instead
- Automatic bundling of transport components code
